### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- vanilla JS

### What I learned

Mostly what I've learned is about JS:

- preventDefault(); (which prevents event from happening until e.g. flag change)

- flag (variable used to indicate whether a certain condition has been met or not.)

- Session Storage (type of web storage that allows you to store key-value pairs in a web browser. Often used to store temporary data that is specific to a single session or tab)

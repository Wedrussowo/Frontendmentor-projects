### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

After this project I:
- understand better process of matching the picture to the container.
- feel more comfortable with the clamp function
- also started to feel more comfy with the scale, translate, positioning

### Continued development

The more projects I do the more Flexbox I use everywhere I can, don't know if it's good x_X
